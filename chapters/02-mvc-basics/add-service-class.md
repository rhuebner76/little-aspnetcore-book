## Add a service class
You've created a model, a view, and a controller. Before you use the model and view in the controller, you also need to write code that will get the user's to-do items from a database.

You could write this database code directly in the controller, but it's a better practice to keep your code separate. Why? In a big, real-world application, you'll have to juggle many concerns:

* **Rendering views** and handling incoming data: this is what your controller already does.
* **Performing business logic**, or code and logic that's related to the purpose and "business" of your application. In a to-do list application, business logic means decisions like setting a default due date on new tasks, or only displaying tasks that are incomplete. Other examples of business logic include calculating a total cost based on product prices and tax rates, or checking whether a player has enough points to level up in a game.
* **Saving and retrieving** items from a database.

Again, it's possible to do all of these things in a single, massive controller, but that quickly becomes too hard to manage and test. Instead, it's common to see applications split up into two, three, or more "layers" or tiers that each handle one (and only one) concern. This helps keep the controllers as simple as possible, and makes it easier to test and change the business logic and database code later.

Separating your application this way is sometimes called a **multi-tier** or **n-tier architecture**. In some cases, the tiers (layers) are isolated in completely separate projects, but other times it just refers to how the classes are organized and used. The important thing is thinking about how to split your application into manageable pieces, and avoid having controllers or bloated classes that try to do everything.

For this project, you'll use two application layers: a **presentation layer** made up of the controllers and views that interact with the user, and a **service layer** that contains business logic and database code. The presentation layer already exists, so the next step is to build a service that handles to-do business logic and saves to-do items to a database.

> Most larger projects use a 3-tier architecture: a presentation layer, a service logic layer, and a data repository layer. A **repository** is a class that's only focused on database code (no business logic). In this application, you'll combine these into a single service layer for simplicity, but feel free to experiment with different ways of architecting the code.

### Create an interface

The C# language includes the concept of **interfaces**, where the definition of an object's methods and properties is separate from the class that actually contains the code for those methods and properties. Interfaces make it easy to keep your classes decoupled and easy to test, as you'll see here (and later in the *Automated testing* chapter). You'll use an interface to represent the service that can interact with to-do items in the database.

By convention, interfaces are prefixed with "I". Create a new file in the Services directory:

**Services/ITodoItemService.cs**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using AspNetCoreTodo.Models;

namespace AspNetCoreTodo.Services
{
    public interface ITodoItemService
    {
        Task<TodoItem[]> GetIncompleteItemsAsync();
    }
}
```

Note that the namespace of this file is `AspNetCoreTodo.Services`. Namespaces are a way to organize .NET code files, and it's customary for the namespace to follow the directory the file is stored in (`AspNetCoreTodo.Services` for files in the `Services` directory, and so on).

Because this file (in the `AspNetCoreTodo.Services` namespace) references the `TodoItem` class (in the `AspNetCoreTodo.Models` namespace), it needs to include a `using` statement at the top of the file to import that namespace. Without the `using` statement, you'll see an error like:

```
The type or namespace name 'TodoItem' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```

Since this is an interface, there isn't any actual code here, just the definition (or **method signature**) of the `GetIncompleteItemsAsync` method. This method requires no parameters and returns a `Task<TodoItem[]>`.

> If this syntax looks confusing, think: "a Task that contains an array of TodoItems".

The `Task` type is similar to a future or a promise, and it's used here because this method will be **asynchronous**. In other words, the method may not be able to return the list of to-do items right away because it needs to go talk to the database first. (More on this later.)

### Create the service class

Now that the interface is defined, you're ready to create the actual service class. I'll cover database code in depth in the *Use a database* chapter, so for now you'll just fake it and always return two hard-coded items:

**Services/FakeTodoItemService.cs**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using AspNetCoreTodo.Models;

namespace AspNetCoreTodo.Services
{
    public class FakeTodoItemService : ITodoItemService
    {
        public Task<TodoItem[]> GetIncompleteItemsAsync()
        {
            var item1 = new TodoItem
            {
                Title = "Learn ASP.NET Core",
                DueAt = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(1)
            };

            var item2 = new TodoItem
            {
                Title = "Build awesome apps",
                DueAt = DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(2)
            };

            return Task.FromResult(new[] { item1, item2 });
        }
    }
}
```

This `FakeTodoItemService` implements the `ITodoItemService` interface but always returns the same array of two `TodoItem`s. You'll use this to test the controller and view, and then add real database code in *Use a database*.
